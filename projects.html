  <h1>Current and Recent Projects</h1>

  <p><ul><li>Developing a public sector property strategy for the West London Alliance to show how assets could be used to increase the supply of affordable housing, improve public services and create a financial return.  This involved developing data base of public sector land and building in West London covering all public bodies including local government, the NHS, GLA family and central government.  More than 2000 properties have been identified.  4 exemplar sites were developed to show how existing public buildings could be intensified. We showed on these 4 sites they could generate new buildings for public services, 300 new homes and bring in £20m of new capital funding.</li></ul></p>

  <p><ul><li>Developing major new revenue streams for the public sector by developing sites for digital outdoor adverts.  This has included site identification, negotiating a profit share agreement with London Underground and managing sensitive sites through to planning permission.</li></ul></p>
